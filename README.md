Code for making connection between physical and digital.

Use Processing to talk to the Internet and access web services, mainly Twitter, but possibly others as needed.
Arduino controls teh physical end
Serial port connection for now between them. Possibly consider WiFi eventually.

Added Dev branch - this is the one I'm playing on.
Master branch is now the current working live version. Dev changes once accepted at working can be merged back into Master

Processing and Arduino code here both may use one or more external libraries. These need installing in Processing as libraries for the code to work.

Also made DEV the default branch
